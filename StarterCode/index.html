        <div id="scatter" , style="text-align: center;"> Income vs. Obesity</h2>
          <p>When looking at the graph, a general trend can be seen. Many of the states that have lower incomes also
            have
            higher obesity rates.
          </p>

          <p>There are several reasons that this trend could be occurring. First, food that is inexpensive to buy
            typically is not
            as healthy for those with lower incomes. Inexpensive food options usually have lower nutritional value than
            foods like
            lean protein, fruits and vegetables. Many people on a fixed income do not buy perishable items because
            they go bad faster.
          </p>

          <p>Another reason is accessibility. It would be interesting to look at the number of grocery stores in each
            state. If there is a
            "food desert" situation, many people eat food that is convenient to get from smaller, non-grocery stores.
            Most
            convenience stores have food that is lower
            in nutritional value because that is what sells better.
